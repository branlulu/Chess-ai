# Chess-ai

## About the project
This project was my final project in the course CPSC 474: Computational Intelligence for Games. It uses the following techniques to develop a Chess Agent:
1. Minimax w/ Alpha-Beta Pruning
2. Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCB

This project will be continually updated as I explore more methods to make a better agent.
